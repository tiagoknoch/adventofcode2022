Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) in C#.

These solutions are provided as is. 
My objective is to simple solve the puzzles. Some solutions are uglier, some prettier.

Each day is one project.
All puzzles should have an `input.txt` file and a `demo.txt` (used for testing). 

Switch between these two if needed.
All puzzles have two parts so there are two methods (`Part1` & `Part2`) available. 

The solution is printed on console.
